# ILMoS

## What is ILMoS?
[Intelligent Library Monitoring System (ILMoS)](https://senior.ceng.metu.edu.tr/2022/ILMoS/) is a deep learning guided project that improves library and study hall experience of users, enables efficient use of libraries, and minimizes abuse of desks. Data coming from the camera(s) deployed is processed by classification algorithms, and changes in the status of the desks are reflected to our database. Our mobile application responds to those changes by updating the status of corresponding desks on the dashboard. This application is aimed to be used in the libraries and study halls; therefore, our expected users are students.
